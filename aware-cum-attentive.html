Any necessity to be (cognitively) attentive only takes place on those occasions when/ where an otherwise ongoing (affective) enjoyment and appreciation diminishes – which attentiveness is initiated by that <a href='diminishment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>diminution</a> in the quality of (affectively) enjoying and appreciating being alive/ being here, each moment again, come-what-may – and occurs less and less once one gets the knack of thus (affectively) monitoring one’s moment-to-moment mood and temperament via the increasingly subtle variations in that quality.

      <div><p>I found dullness and boredom one of the most common reactions to being alive when things weren’t going ‘my’ way – and they rarely ever did or that life wasn’t exciting, which it rarely was. In the process of actualism I recognized, however, that my <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>habitual resentment</span> towards the various facts of life, for instance having to work 🏢 for a living, bad weather, getting sick, etc, clearly prevented me from becoming happy and <a href='harmless' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>harmless</a>. I discovered I could either indulge in ‘my’ resentment or pull myself up by my boot strings and break this insidious habit. As No 3 pointed out, it was indeed a matter of priority – and I chose sensuous <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>attentiveness</a> over ‘self’-indulgent apathy, happiness over resentment.</p></div>

When feelings cause one’s awareness to wander from actualism’s focus, it is attentiveness that reminds one that one’s mind is being manipulated … and why one is <strong>doing this happening called being alive</strong>. It is attentiveness that brings one back to the object of actualism: <a href='apperception' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>apperception</a>.</p></div>

    <div class='pl-2 mt-2 border-l-2 border-pink-200 hover:border-pink-500'>
      <div><p>[..] We were chatting the other day about the marked difference between <strong>being here, doing what is happening</strong> and the feeling of not being here that can cause a <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>frustration</span> with life as-it-is. The frustration with life as-it-is, right here and now, most often causes a passionate desire to be <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>somewhere else</span> which serves only to prevent one from being here. For an actualist, any period of time spent not being here is clearly a waste of time. Any time spent being <a href='boredom' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>bored</a>, angry, pissed off, feeling sad, lack luster, annoyed, etc. is time wasted time lost from fully living this the only moment one can experience being alive. All of these ‘time-offs’ have to be explored and investigated and understood so as to prevent the same old ‘time-outs’ occurring in the future. It takes a bit of practice and a lot of <a href='diligence' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>effort</a> and <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>attention</a> as to <a href='HAIETMOBA' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>‘how’ am I experiencing this moment of being alive</a>, but pretty soon one gets the hang of it.</p></div>

By doing so, I discovered that this <strong>basic resentment</strong> towards being here had various branches – one of them was that in most cases people, including me, have to work 🏢 for their livelihood. Once I stopped resenting the fact that I have to trade some of my time and expertise in exchange for tokens, which I then use for buying food, clothes, shelter and toys, my whole attitude towards and experience of work began to change. Not only is food a requisite, it is also a pleasure, not only are clothes a requisite, they provide warmth and comfort, not only is shelter a requisite, it provides comfort, cosiness and convenience and any money left over after purchasing necessities can purchase what toys I find interesting from the increasingly inexpensive and ever-widening array of adult toys.</p></div>

      <div><p>PETER: [..] an essential first step is to take a long look at one’s own deeply-ingrained <strong>resentment at being born and having to be here</strong>. If one cares to break this <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>habit</span> of feeling resentful – and avoid the traditional antidotal trap of feeling <a href='gratitude' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>gratitude</a> to Someone or Something – the fact that one no longer <strong>feels resentful for being here</strong> disempowers the very driving force for one’s resentfulness towards one’s fellow human beings together with feelings such as anger, pity, jealousy and envy. The accompanying essential step is to stop focussing one’s attention on how you perceive, as in intuitively feel, others to be and to start <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>paying exclusive attention</a> to the only person whose feelings, intentions, <a href='sincerity' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>sincerity</a> and integrity you can know for certain – <a href='identity/genetic' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>‘me’</a>.</p></div>
