This section of the website is being published solely for the benefit of those who are [[Benevolence and Naivete|naive enough]] to consider the notion that the ‘wisdom of the real-world’ was not set in stone, and as such it rules out those that identifies themselves as a spiritualist, an atheist, a rationalist or anything of that ilk[^ex].

[^ex]: A simple test to see if you belong to such a group is to assess your feelings when reading actualism text. You may use [this index](http://actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/commonobjections/croindex.htm) to compare your reactions against the documented spectrum of entrenched cognitive dissonance in action.

This is a different kind of index into the [Actual Freedom website][AFTweb] that acts as an easy 'portal', and as well as serves as atomic notes (of [[Zettelkasten]] kind) for linking to from elsewhere.

Start with [[Actualism Method]] if you wish to get to the nitty-gritty of what this is all about ... or browse the various notes below.

NOTE: These notes may be out of date as of Jan, 2022.
