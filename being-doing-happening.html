    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      RICHARD: Are you able to contemplate the atmosphere of your <a href='pce' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>pure consciousness experience</a>? By contemplation I do not mean trying to feel the experience; a peak experience is not a matter of emotions and passions, it is in a realm of its own, as you may remember. Contemplation, to work successfully, needs to be pure … stripped of emotive thought. For a moment allow yourself to set aside – not give up – your psychological state of <em>‘being’</em>, which is occupied by the latest accumulation of worries and preoccupations. Make all of your <em>identity</em> unimportant, for now, and contemplate the perfection of <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here now</a>. Allow <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment</a> to live you, instead of you living in the present. Experience yourself as <strong>being the doing of what is happening</strong>. An immediate peace and <a href='stillness' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>calm</a> emerges and all is wiped clean, allowing a three-hundred-and-sixty degree awareness to operate. It is like having eyes in the back of your head. In this clean atmosphere you can freely allow the pure quality of the immediacy of this moment to become paramount. It is of itself not at all concerned with the culturally defined personality you were just before; it takes no notice of any ‘problem’ that has just been plaguing you and is calmly unperturbed by any psychological interference. Instantly the friendly solution to all humankind’s problems lies open all around. It is a condition which cannot be mistaken as anything else than authentic, as it is your very character. It is the simple, actual quality of the universe itself … it is a magical world … a fairytale-like wonderland. In this, the actual world, love, worship and adulation – the whole <em>Spiritual</em> gamut of surrender and obedience – do not play a role. <em>Divinity</em> has become obsolete as a solution, because what you are seeing and experiencing now is pre-eminent. An intimacy closer than you have ever been with yourself, as you normally are, has replaced everything else … this kind familiarity has superseded all what humans have ever believed as being <em>The Truth</em>.
    </p>

      PETER: There seems to be a very deep-set misunderstanding that arises even from the running of the question <em>‘<a href='HAIETMOBA' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>How am I experiencing this moment of being alive</a>?’</em> for the traditional approach would be – am ‘I’ feeling safe and comfortable ‘inside’ this body despite what is happening in the rock-solid world ‘out there’? This approach to the question merely perpetuates the self as an entity that is separate from the actual world, it does nothing to actively demolish and break down the barriers that prevents one as a mortal flesh and blood body being fully immersed in and engaged in the business of <strong>doing what is happening</strong>, <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>right here and now</a> in the physical, rock-solid actual world. This actual freedom is 180 degrees opposite to the spiritual freedom which is the escape from being here, right now in <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this only moment</a> one can experience being alive.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      [..] We were chatting the other day about the marked difference between <strong>being here, doing what is happening</strong> and the feeling of not being here that can cause a <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>frustration</span> with life as-it-is. The frustration with life as-it-is, right here and now, most often causes a passionate desire to be <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>somewhere else</span> which serves only to prevent one from being here. For an actualist, any period of time spent not being here is clearly a waste of time. Any time spent being <a href='boredom' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>bored</a>, angry, pissed off, feeling sad, lack luster, annoyed, etc. is time wasted time lost from fully living this the only moment one can experience being alive. All of these ‘time-offs’ have to be explored and investigated and understood so as to prevent the same old ‘time-outs’ occurring in the future. It takes a bit of practice and a lot of <a href='diligence' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>effort</a> and <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>attention</a> as to <a href='HAIETMOBA' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>‘how’ am I experiencing this moment of being alive</a>, but pretty soon one gets the hang of it.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Soon one finds that a switch has been made from <a href='basic-resentment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being resentful</a> at having to <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>be here</a> to resenting and wanting to eliminate whatever it is that prevents one from being here.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      [Peter]: For me the main event is always here and now, which means if I am living with someone then I have no concern about when, how or if it will end. If I am not happy now, if I am annoyed, moody, discontent, out of it, lacklustre, sad or whatever then I am somewhere else but <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>here and now</a>, not <strong>doing what is happening</strong> in this moment of time. By fully taking on board the fact that <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this very moment</a> is the only moment I can experience, means that I have abandoned the idea of <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>postponement</span>. For me there is no end of this relationship for, if it happens, it is not happening now. The exquisiteness and <a href='sensuousness' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>sensual</a> <a href='delight' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>delight</a> of being here, <strong>doing what is happening</strong>, means the ending of <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>the idea that I am coming from somewhere or that I am going somewhere</span>. Freedom lies in being absolutely locked into, and fully committed to this very moment of time – to fully embrace being a flesh and blood human being on this paradisiacal material earth.

      VINEETO: The main fuel for this feeling of <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>impatience</span> comes from the notion that there is <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>something better ‘out there’</span>, in the future – that magic ingredient that will then make life as perfect as the ending of children’s fairytale – and then they lived happily ever after. And yet it is this very feeling of impatience, that particular bit of my ‘self’, that prevents me from the sensate-only experiencing the perfection of <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      [..] So impatience gets replaced by an understanding of <strong>redundancy</strong> – the more I experientially understand about the human condition the more ‘I’ become redundant because life in the actual world is utterly safe and already perfect. ‘I’ am not needed to stay alive. The more I understand the chemical, psychological and psychic programming of the brain, the more I can see that this programming is outdated, faulty and redundant in every single aspect – ‘I’ am not needed at all. Virtual Freedom is the ongoing increasing experience of ‘my’ redundancy, kind of getting used to not interfering with perfection. The way I see it now is that death is simply an extension of this continuing discovery of ‘me’, the spoiler, being redundant, turning 98% redundancy to 99% and 99% to 100% … … pop.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      The only way I can reach this 100% redundancy is by <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here all the time</a>, <strong>doing what is happening</strong> without emotionally interfering – and if there is an emotion, then investigating it, nutting it out, sitting it out, thinking it through, understanding its follies and furphies. In the end, every emotion is understood as nothing but an objection to and fear of <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here</a> – and an objection to being <strong>redundant</strong> as an entity.

      <strong>Richard:</strong> It happens on its own in that, as ‘I’ am the instinctual passions and the instinctual passions are ‘me’, there is no way that ‘I’ can end ‘me’. What ‘I’ do is that ‘I’ deliberately and consciously and with knowledge aforethought set in motion a ‘process’ that will ensure ‘my’ demise. What ‘I’ do, voluntarily and willingly, is to press the button – which is to acquiesce – which precipitates an oft-times alarming but always thrilling momentum that will result in ‘my’ inevitable self-immolation. The acquiescing is that one thus dedicates oneself to <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here</a> as <strong>the universe’s experience of itself now</strong> … it is the unreserved !YES! to being alive as this flesh and blood body. Peace-on-earth is the inevitable result of such devotion because it is already here … it is always here now. ‘I’ and/or ‘me’ was merely standing in the way of the always already existing perfect purity from becoming apparent by sitting back and moaning and groaning about the inequity of it all (as epitomised in ‘I didn’t ask to be born’). How can one be forever sticking one’s toe in and testing out the waters and yet expect to be able to look at oneself in the mirror each morning with dignity. The act of initiating this ‘process’ – acquiescence – is to embrace death.

      PETER: The commonly held belief is that the excitement and tension that results from instinctual fear is essential to feeling alive and many actively court danger in order to ride the rush of fear. Contrary to this belief, the experience of the near-elimination of instinctual fear allows the <strong>thrill of doing what is happening</strong> to become increasingly apparent – and this includes <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>doing nothing</span> really well. Again it is universally upheld as a truth that one needs the instinct of aggression, currently manifest in the phrase ‘standing up for my rights’, or else I will be trampled, done in, taken advantage of, etc. What is discovered is quite the opposite, for one increasingly discovers that the actual world is a safe place, brim full of serendipity, <a href='delight' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>delight</a> and wonder.

      VINEETO: I am currently attempting to understand the process of approaching death, the combination of self-immolation and <strong>doing what is happening</strong>. I have always been puzzled by the apparent paradox of the fact that only ‘I’ can bring about my demise and the question how the last bit of ‘me’ is going to disappear. This is how I experience it now –
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Sometimes, in the course of a perfect day, ‘I’ have a more substantial experience of an emotion, usually felt as fear, tension in the head or/and in the stomach area. Over the period of the last weeks I have come to understand my own journey as less of a ‘psychic and psychological search and destroy mission’ and more of as a physical affair, where thebrain is sorting out the necessary neuron-links to adjust to the dismantling of ‘me’. And the only thing that ‘I’ can do now to support my self-immolation process is to get out of the road, to not stand on the brakes. The process is happening and so, for freedom’s sake, Vineeto, get off the brakes!
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      I do that by neither dramatising the fear nor pushing it away, by seeing it more as a by-product of this strange thing I am doing. I don’t ‘support’ a panic-attack by embroidering it, and neither do I let myself be numb, bored or dull. Then, by quietly noticing what is happening, without attaching any identity to an ‘observer’, <a href='apperception' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>apperception</a> happens – with some rumbling going on in the background – while I get on with the pleasures of being here, be they food, sex, a walk into town, playing with the web-site, interaction with other people, going to work or watching television. And by ‘my’ stepping out of the way I am <strong>doing what is happening</strong>, any rumbling or grinding in the background included.

      SRID: the opposite of feeling vulnerable is that one becomes interested in people and events happening right now. during the day we first met <a href='grace-scale' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>grace</a>, i remember using the expression of ‘<strong>doing of what is happening</strong>’ to richard upon noticing that there was ‘less of me’ as i was, for most part, simply being the felicitous interaction happening on the house boat. closer to the end of the trip i also confirmed that this is the direction to take in order to get to out-from-control/ different-way-of-being.

      PETER: You need <a href='diligence' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>a good deal of gas</a> in the tank initially and eventually you’ll come to a stage when you find yourself careering along, looking for the brakes and finding there are none. Then, as soon as you dare to, you take your hands off the wheel and sit back and be aware of <strong>doing what is happening</strong> and amazement, wonder and <a href='delight' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>delight</a> come flooding in to fill the hole that is left when ‘you’ <a href='pce' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>temporarily abdicate the throne</a>. When you do this often enough, and find that the actual world is not only safe but pure and perfect, you become aware of your destiny.

      <div><p><strong>RICHARD</strong>: Are you able to contemplate the atmosphere of your <a href='pce' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>pure consciousness experience</a>? By contemplation I do not mean trying to feel the experience; a peak experience is not a matter of emotions and passions, it is in a realm of its own, as you may remember. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>Contemplation, to work successfully, needs to be pure … stripped of emotive thought</span>. For a moment allow yourself to set aside – not give up – your psychological state of <em>‘being’</em>, which is occupied by the latest accumulation of worries and preoccupations. Make all of your <em>identity</em> unimportant, for now, and contemplate the perfection of being here now. Allow this moment to live you, instead of you living in the present. Experience yourself as <a href='being-doing-happening' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>Being the doing of what is happening</a>. An immediate peace and calm emerges and all is wiped clean, allowing a three-hundred-and-sixty degree awareness to operate. It is like having eyes in the back of your head. In this clean atmosphere you can freely allow the <strong>pure</strong> quality of the immediacy of this moment to become paramount. It is of itself not at all concerned with the culturally defined personality you were just before; it takes no notice of any ‘problem’ that has just been plaguing you and is calmly unperturbed by any psychological interference. Instantly the friendly solution to all humankind’s problems lies open all around. It is a condition which cannot be mistaken as anything else than authentic, as it is your very character. It is the simple, actual quality of the universe itself … it is a magical world … a fairytale-like wonderland. In this, the actual world, <a href='love' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>love</a>, worship and adulation – the whole <em>Spiritual</em> gamut of surrender and obedience – do not play a role. <em>Divinity</em> has become obsolete as a solution, because what you are seeing and experiencing now is pre-eminent. An intimacy closer than you have ever been with yourself, as you normally are, has replaced everything else … this kind familiarity has superseded all what humans have ever believed as being <em>The Truth</em>.</p></div>

      <div><p>Richard: To get out of ‘stuckness’ one gets off one’s backside and does whatever one knows best to activate <strong>delight</strong>. Delight is what is humanly possible, given sufficient pure intent obtained from the felicity/ <a href='harmless' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>innocuity</a> born of the <a href='pce' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>pure consciousness experience</a>, and from the position of delight, one can vitalise one’s joie de vivre by the <a href='fascination' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>amazement</a> at the fun of it all … and then one can – with sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into marvelling at <a href='being-here-now' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here</a> and <a href='being-doing-happening' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>doing this business called being alive now</a>. Then one is no longer intuitively making sense of life … the delicious wonder of it all drives any such instinctive meaning away. Such luscious wonder fosters the innate condition of <a href='benevolence-naivete' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>naiveté</a> – the nourishing of which is essential if fascination in it all is to occur – and the charm of life itself easily engages dedication to peace-on-earth. Then, as one gazes intently at the world about by glancing lightly with sensuously caressing eyes, out of the corner of one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like paradise that this verdant earth actually is … and one is the <a href='being-doing-happening' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>experiencing of what is happening</a>.

      <div><p><strong>Being here now</strong> is to put your money where your mouth is, as it were. All other actions are methods, devices, techniques … which are, in effect, delaying tactics. The most sincere form of flattery is not, as is commonly practised, imitating all the other people’s performance of standing back and expressing a feeling. To feel an emotion or be passionate about life is nowhere near the same as actually being here now. In being here <a href='this-moment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>now</a> one is completely involved. Being here now is total inclusion. One demonstrates one’s appreciation of life by partaking fully in existence … by letting this moment live one so that one is <a href='being-doing-happening' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>doing what is happening</a>. One dedicates oneself to the challenge of being here now as the universe’s experience of itself. When ‘I’ willingly and voluntarily sacrifice ‘myself’ – the psychological or psychic identity residing inside this body – ‘I’ am gladly making ‘my’ most supreme donation, for ‘I’ am what one holds most dear.</p></div>
