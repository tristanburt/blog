    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      RICHARD: One of the main keys to success is a focus on time itself as a sensate experience. My oft-repeated refrain is this: ‘The first step to being free is the actual understanding that <strong>this moment in time is the only place where being alive happens</strong>. The past, although it was actual when it did happen, is not actual now. The future, although it will be actual when it does happen, is <a href='no-next-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>not actual now</a>. Only now is actual and as it is always now then the purity of innocence is perpetually here already … where <strong>time has no duration</strong>. Then what one is – as this body being apperceptively aware – is this material universe experiencing itself as a sensate, reflective human being. The physical space of this universe is infinite and its time is eternal … thus the infinitude of this very material universe has no beginning and no ending … and therefore no middle. There are no edges to this universe, which means that there is no centre, either. We are all coming from nowhere and are not going anywhere for there is nowhere to come from nor anywhere to go to. We are nowhere in particular … which means we are anywhere at all’.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      To be the consciousness of the infinitude … it is no little thing that one does.

      <div><p>RICHARD: There is no worry, no, but I am not too sure that this is because there is no ‘I’ … it is simply silly to worry as worrying does nothing whatsoever to get an event changed. I correct – and thus improve – what can be corrected … according to a preference for creature comforts and ease of life-style. For example: if I can sit upon a cushion instead of the brick pavers of the patio I will … that is a preference. But if a cushion is not available it does not matter … I thoroughly enjoy being alive at <a href='this-moment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment</a> in eternal time and this place in infinite space irregardless of what is happening. I could be just as happy and <a href='harmless' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>harmless</a> on bread and water in solitary confinement in some insalubrious penitentiary … but I would be pretty silly to act or behave in such a way as to occasion that outcome! The ‘I’ that used to inhabit this body did everything possible that ‘I’ could do to blatantly imitate the actual in that ‘I’ endeavoured to be happy and harmless for as much as is humanly possible. This was achieved by putting everything on a <strong>‘it doesn’t really matter’ basis</strong>. That is, ‘I’ would prefer people, things and events to be a particular way, but if it did not turn out like that … it did not really matter for it was only a preference. ‘I’ chose to no longer give other people – or the weather – the power to make ‘me’ angry … or irritated … or even peeved, if that was possible. It was great fun and very, very rewarding along the way. ‘My’ life became cleaner and clearer and more and more pure as each habitual way of living life was consciously eliminated through constant exposure. Finally ‘I’ invited the actual by letting go of the controls and letting this moment live ‘me’. ‘I’ became the experience of the doing of this business of being alive … no longer the ‘do-er’. Thus ‘my’ days were numbered … ‘I’ could hardly maintain ‘myself’ … soon ‘my’ time would come to an end. An inevitability set in and a thrilling momentum took over … ‘my’ demise became imminent.</p></div>

      <div><p>PETER: There seems to be a very deep-set misunderstanding that arises even from the running of the question <em>‘<a href='HAIETMOBA' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>How am I experiencing this moment of being alive</a>?’</em> for the traditional approach would be – am ‘I’ feeling safe and comfortable ‘inside’ this body despite what is happening in the rock-solid world ‘out there’? This approach to the question merely perpetuates the self as an entity that is separate from the actual world, it does nothing to actively demolish and break down the barriers that prevents one as a mortal flesh and blood body being fully immersed in and engaged in the business of <strong>doing what is happening</strong>, <a href='being-here-now' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>right here and now</a> in the physical, rock-solid actual world.

By contemplation I do not mean trying to feel the experience; a peak experience is not a matter of emotions and passions, it is in a realm of its own, as you may remember. Contemplation, to work successfully, needs to be pure … stripped of emotive thought. For a moment allow yourself to set aside – not give up – your psychological state of <em>‘being’</em>, which is occupied by the latest accumulation of worries and preoccupations. Make all of your <em>identity</em> unimportant, for now, and contemplate the perfection of <a href='being-here-now' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here now</a>. Allow <a href='this-moment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment</a> to live you, instead of you living in the present. Experience yourself as <strong>being the doing of what is happening</strong>. An immediate peace and <a href='stillness' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>calm</a> emerges and all is wiped clean, allowing a three-hundred-and-sixty degree awareness to operate. It is like having eyes in the back of your head. In this clean atmosphere you can freely allow the pure quality of the immediacy of this moment to become paramount. It is of itself not at all concerned with the culturally defined personality you were just before; it takes no notice of any ‘problem’ that has just been plaguing you and is calmly unperturbed by any psychological interference. Instantly the friendly solution to all humankind’s problems lies open all around. It is a condition which cannot be mistaken as anything else than authentic, as it is your very character. It is the simple, actual quality of the universe itself … it is a magical world … a fairytale-like wonderland. In this, the actual world, love, worship and adulation – the whole <em>Spiritual</em> gamut of surrender and obedience – do not play a role. <em>Divinity</em> has become obsolete as a solution, because what you are seeing and experiencing now is pre-eminent. An intimacy closer than you have ever been with yourself, as you normally are, has replaced everything else … this kind familiarity has superseded all what humans have ever believed as being <em>The Truth</em>.</p></div>

      <div><p><strong>Being here now</strong> is to put your money where your mouth is, as it were. All other actions are methods, devices, techniques … which are, in effect, delaying tactics.

To feel an emotion or be passionate about life is nowhere near the same as actually being here now. In being here <a href='this-moment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>now</a> one is completely involved. Being here now is total inclusion.

Once I stopped resenting the fact that I have to trade some of my time and expertise in exchange for tokens, which I then use for buying food, clothes, shelter and toys, my whole attitude towards and experience of work began to change. Not only is food a requisite, it is also a pleasure, not only are clothes a requisite, they provide warmth and comfort, not only is shelter a requisite, it provides comfort, cosiness and convenience and any money left over after purchasing necessities can purchase what toys I find interesting from the increasingly inexpensive and ever-widening array of adult toys.</p></div>
