In here lies <strong>security, utter safety</strong>. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>Nothing can go ultimately wrong inside <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>eternal time</a>, all is forever well</span>. It is only when one thinks and feels that <em>‘I’</em> exist that the troubles begin. To locate this entity, one has only to tune into the feeling of <em>‘being’</em>. In <em>‘being’</em> there is a sense of <em>‘presence’</em>, a feeling of being present. [..]
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      To be an entity is to be forever locked-out of eternal time. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'><strong>Complete security</strong> lies inside eternal time</span>. <em>‘I’</em> will never look into eternal time; for <em>‘me’</em> eternal time is an enemy to be avoided at all costs. <em>‘I’</em> condemn <em>‘myself’</em> to the endless <a href='identity-building' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>creation of grandiose schemes</a> to save my <em>soul</em>; <em>‘I’</em> concoct all kinds of fantasies about <em>Other-Worldly Dimensions. ‘I’</em> have to believe in multitudinous <em>Heavenly Kingdoms</em> wherein <em>‘I’</em> can reside as an <em>Immaculate Spirit</em> for all of <em>Eternity. ‘I’</em> am driven to <a href='identity-building' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>spin dreams and illusions</a> because <em>‘I’</em> refuse to see what lies here on earth … right under <em>‘my’</em> nose, as it were. <em>‘I’</em> can never live inside eternal time … whereas I as this flesh and blood body can only be here now. Inside this body there is no <em>‘being’</em> … nothing psychological or psychic left for <em>‘I’</em> am extinct. Time is a blessing, not a curse. I can never be out of time, nor anywhere but here, for I have actualised my destiny … here on earth and now in time.

      RICHARD: [..] it is perfect the universe can ‘do its thing’ with absolute certainty. We can rely upon its certainty through memory, which is the history of events, and see that there is a consistency to events. The sun rises each morning and sets each evening. That is reliable, and we can make plans accordingly. If the sun did not rise tomorrow we would not be alive to know that it did not. Therefore, there is dependability born out of the perfection. Ultimately nothing can go wrong – and this is where <strong>security</strong> lies. I could break a leg or get a disease, which causes discomfort, but it is not an indication that life is ‘going wrong’.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      This is the peculiar part about an actual freedom. <strong>Utter security</strong>. The <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>absolute certainty that nothing can go wrong in an ultimate sense</span> brings completion. This is perfection … but not in the human concept of perfection. For them perfection means disease-free.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      VINEETO: [..] belonging is about <em>feeling</em> part of a group for emotional support, for <strong>security</strong> of one’s <a href='belief' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>beliefs</a> and for company in loneliness and misery. I have experienced and examined my beliefs, emotions, instinctual passions, urges, needs and fears around this issue in me and they no longer have any impact on me.

      I don’t belong to any group and I have dared to <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>acknowledge the fact that I am on my own</span> – in fact, I as this flesh-and-blood body <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>have been on my own all my life</span> despite my feelings of belonging or not belonging. For the path to an actual freedom I rely on my own <a href='pce' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>pure consciousness experiences</a> to know what I want to achieve and I found that the <a href='method' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>method of actualism</a> works to make me happy and <a href='harmless' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>harmless</a>.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      RICHARD: With <a href='apperception' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>apperception</a>, what one discovers, time and again, is that the <strong>personal boundaries</strong> that one feels so safely protected by, are made up of ‘my’ accrued <a href='belief' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>beliefs</a> as to who ‘I’ am. This is ‘my’ outline, as it were, shaped by other people’s description of ‘me’ … a construct which gives ‘me’ asylum in each different group into which ‘I’ wish to enter. Yet the outline of this construct creates, simultaneously, an enormous distance between ‘me’ and the world outside. At those times of <a href='pce' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>peak experience</a>, the distance disappears all of a sudden as ‘I’ vanish and this world is right here, so close that there is no distance any more. This is closer than any affective intimacy ‘I’ have ever longed for. This is serendipity indeed. This is a direct experience of actuality … and I have always been here like this … so <strong>safely</strong> here. The outline, the boundary that created the distance, was all in ‘my’ reality. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>‘I’ created a <strong>substitute security</strong> for this <strong>original safety</strong></span> … a safety which has never known any threat, nor ever will. This genuine safety has no need for precautions.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      [..] To defend the <a href='belief' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>belief</a> that this life is forever fatally flawed – defend to the point of idiocy – is actually a cowardly attempt to stay hidden inside ‘humanity’. To skulk behind a sick social contract is a desperate ploy to remain ‘human’. If one takes one’s intellectual ability back from the <a href='identity/social' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>decrees of the cultured sophisticates</a> – to which one has surrendered – one has taken a courageous step. One has cast oneself out of the biggest group there is … humanity. If one stays within the group, for its <strong>perceived safety and security</strong>, one is selling out to the system because of a pusillanimous character.

      RICHARD: [..] the eternal cry of each group-member, each <em>identity,</em> is: ‘But what about me? You only love me for what I do, for what role I play, for my looks, for my bank-balance … or for whatever attribute that has <strong>secured</strong> my place. I want to be loved for me, a unique individual!’ Yet this ‘unique individual’ only knows itself as a group-member. It defends itself as being part of the whole. All that area of <em>‘myself’</em> which cannot be displayed publicly must be kept secret. <em>‘My’</em> deepest feelings, <em>‘my’</em> objections, <em>‘my’</em> goals, must be suppressed in order not to upset the status-quo of the group … and therefore, <em>‘my’</em> precious ‘safety’. Their <a href='love' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>love</a> for <em>‘me’</em>, their acceptance, is paramount. <em>‘I’</em> must sell-out me as-I-am in order to belong.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      PETER: Even if a woman had a man, this offered no <strong>security</strong>, so she had to continuously hone and test her seductive powers on other men in case they were needed at any time. She knew that when these powers failed, when beauty faded, when old age set in, she was useless, on the scrap heap. This behaviour is all too evident in current times: women’s magazines bear testimony to this, with their endless beauty and seductive tips. The threat of failure or loss of male protection meant that the support of the other women around the campfire was all she could ultimately fall back on; hence the woman’s loyalty to the ‘sisterhood’ is much stronger than her loyalty to her man.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      • [Respondent]: ‘Some thoughts on what it means to be ‘spiritual’. On the one hand, being ‘spiritual’ can mean believing in a god, truth (by whatever name), the afterlife, etc. i.e. – belief in the supernatural. On the other hand, being <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>‘spiritual’</span> can refer to an attitude or outlook on life which values such things as family, community and community service, a feeling of unity with the universe and all peoples and beings. It is this second sense of the word ‘spiritual’ that everyone inevitably shares to some extent. As a feeling being ‘I’ cannot help but attempt to unite my ‘self’ with other ‘selves’ for <strong>security and fortification</strong>. It is ‘my’ very nature to do so. […snip…]. Not too long ago, I attended a single Humanist meeting. I was surprised to find out that on the one hand, spiritual beliefs were shunned as primitive belief, yet ‘spirituality’ (as in community, connection with all beings, etc) was quite important.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      So, even in a room where I presume were mostly atheists, spirituality was accepted and sacrosanct. As I see it, this is the reason why it is a important insight that virtually everyone is ‘spiritual’ at least in their desire to connect with others, the truth, the universe, or whatever. It is the ‘real’ existence of the psychic web which makes the feeling of unity possible and the search for this unity in whatever form the essence of the ‘spiritual’.
