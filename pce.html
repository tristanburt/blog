This is ‘my’ outline, as it were, shaped by other people’s description of ‘me’ … a construct which gives ‘me’ asylum in each different group into which ‘I’ wish to enter. Yet the outline of this construct creates, simultaneously, an enormous distance between ‘me’ and the world outside. At those times of <a href='pce' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>peak experience</a>, the distance disappears all of a sudden as ‘I’ vanish and this world is right here, so close that there is no distance any more. This is closer than any affective intimacy ‘I’ have ever longed for. This is serendipity indeed. This is a direct experience of actuality … and I have always been here like this … so <strong>safely</strong> here. The outline, the boundary that created the distance, was all in ‘my’ reality. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>‘I’ created a <strong>substitute security</strong> for this <strong>original safety</strong></span> … a safety which has never known any threat, nor ever will.

In the PCEs <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>the <strong>security or confidence</strong> instilled by (physical) location in eternal time and infinite space</span> is unmistakable.

Visually, the contrast of light and dark is heightened, colours are richer. Hearing is unrestricted, sounds are welcome.

By contemplation I do not mean trying to feel the experience; a peak experience is not a matter of emotions and passions, it is in a realm of its own, as you may remember. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>Contemplation, to work successfully, needs to be pure … stripped of emotive thought</span>. For a moment allow yourself to set aside – not give up – your psychological state of <em>‘being’</em>, which is occupied by the latest accumulation of worries and preoccupations. Make all of your <em>identity</em> unimportant, for now, and contemplate the perfection of being here now. Allow this moment to live you, instead of you living in the present. Experience yourself as <a href='being-doing-happening' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>Being the doing of what is happening</a>. An immediate peace and calm emerges and all is wiped clean, allowing a three-hundred-and-sixty degree awareness to operate. It is like having eyes in the back of your head. In this clean atmosphere you can freely allow the <strong>pure</strong> quality of the immediacy of this moment to become paramount. It is of itself not at all concerned with the culturally defined personality you were just before; it takes no notice of any ‘problem’ that has just been plaguing you and is calmly unperturbed by any psychological interference. Instantly the friendly solution to all humankind’s problems lies open all around. It is a condition which cannot be mistaken as anything else than authentic, as it is your very character. It is the simple, actual quality of the universe itself … it is a magical world … a fairytale-like wonderland. In this, the actual world, <a href='love' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>love</a>, worship and adulation – the whole <em>Spiritual</em> gamut of surrender and obedience – do not play a role. <em>Divinity</em> has become obsolete as a solution, because what you are seeing and experiencing now is pre-eminent. An intimacy closer than you have ever been with yourself, as you normally are, has replaced everything else … this kind familiarity has superseded all what humans have ever believed as being <em>The Truth</em>.</p></div>

This will give you that <strong>optimism</strong> that is the ability to plough on regardless of whatever stands in your way until you evoke your destiny. It is not a matter of having faith or believing that it is possible; it is not a matter of trusting or hoping that it will happen to you; it is all to do with the solid knowing, born out of the peak experience, that it is here for you and anyone … if only you will act upon your knowing. This ‘action’ amounts to – at times – ‘talking yourself into it’, for the other alternative is to let doubt and <a href='belief' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>disbelief</a> and distrust and despair eat away at your resolve.

When you do this often enough, and find that the actual world is not only safe but pure and perfect, you become aware of your destiny.</p></div>

      <div><p>RICHARD: Are you able to contemplate the atmosphere of your <a href='pce' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>pure consciousness experience</a>? By contemplation I do not mean trying to feel the experience; a peak experience is not a matter of emotions and passions, it is in a realm of its own, as you may remember. Contemplation, to work successfully, needs to be pure … stripped of emotive thought. For a moment allow yourself to set aside – not give up – your psychological state of <em>‘being’</em>, which is occupied by the latest accumulation of worries and preoccupations. Make all of your <em>identity</em> unimportant, for now, and contemplate the perfection of <a href='being-here-now' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here now</a>. Allow <a href='this-moment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment</a> to live you, instead of you living in the present. Experience yourself as <strong>being the doing of what is happening</strong>. An immediate peace and <a href='stillness' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>calm</a> emerges and all is wiped clean, allowing a three-hundred-and-sixty degree awareness to operate. It is like having eyes in the back of your head. In this clean atmosphere you can freely allow the pure quality of the immediacy of this moment to become paramount. It is of itself not at all concerned with the culturally defined personality you were just before; it takes no notice of any ‘problem’ that has just been plaguing you and is calmly unperturbed by any psychological interference. Instantly the friendly solution to all humankind’s problems lies open all around. It is a condition which cannot be mistaken as anything else than authentic, as it is your very character. It is the simple, actual quality of the universe itself … it is a magical world … a fairytale-like wonderland. In this, the actual world, love, worship and adulation – the whole <em>Spiritual</em> gamut of surrender and obedience – do not play a role. <em>Divinity</em> has become obsolete as a solution, because what you are seeing and experiencing now is pre-eminent. An intimacy closer than you have ever been with yourself, as you normally are, has replaced everything else … this kind familiarity has superseded all what humans have ever believed as being <em>The Truth</em>.</p></div>

      <div><p>[Richard]: ‘Speaking personally, the first thing I did in 1981 was to put an end to anger once and for all … then I was freed enough to live in virtual freedom. It took me about three weeks and I have never experienced anger<sup>*</sup> since then. The <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>first step was to say ‘YES’ to <a href='being-here-now' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here</a> on earth</span>, for I located and identified that <strong>basic resentment</strong> that all people that I have spoken to have. To wit: ‘I didn’t ask to be born!’ This is why remembering a <a href='pce' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>PCE</a> is so important for success for it shows one, first hand, that freedom is already always here … now. With the memory of that crystal-clear perfection <a href='rememoration' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>held firmly in mind</a> … that basic resentment goes. Then it is a relatively easy task to eliminate anger forever. One does this by neither expressing or repressing anger when an event happens that would previously trigger an outbreak. Anger is thus put into a bind … and the third alternative hoves into view’.</p></div>
