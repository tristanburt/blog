[The Trust Equation](https://trustedadvisor.com/why-trust-matters/understanding-trust/understanding-the-trust-equation) (see Twitter summary in [this thread](https://twitter.com/ryan_caldbeck/status/1013626221601738754?lang=en)) provides a way to *measure* aspects of [[Trust]] without relying exclusively on subjective appraisals like intuition.

```{.flex .items-center .justify-center .italic .text-lg}
Trust = Credibility x Reliability x Vulnerability
```

- **Credibility** indicates whether someone is ==able== to do what they say.
- **Reliability** indicates whether they ==actually do== it.
- **Vulnerability** indicates whether someone ==sincerely admits one's weaknesses== (eg: what one does not know).

Vulnerability also involves a good deal of the element of *intuition*, and is concomitant with a lowering of habitual defenses for enabling a more direct (thus "vulnerable") way of relating among people [[Genetic Identity|with a self]], as opposed to engaging habitually in [self-presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression_management#Self-presentation). For a less self-centered approach, see [[Benevolence and Naivete|Naivet√©]] and [[Harmlessness]].
