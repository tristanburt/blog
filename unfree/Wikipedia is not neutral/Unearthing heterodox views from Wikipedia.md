Wikipedia is [[Wikipedia is not neutral|not trust worthy]] in controversial topics. Here's a trick I use to extract heterodox views on topics which are otherwise censored in Wikipedia.

1.  Visit the wikipedia article for any controversial article
2.  Click 'View history'
3.  Look for large reverts in bold red (which are not obvious vandalism)
4.  See what got removed

For example, the topic of 'sexual objectification' is not exactly uncontroversial. And heterodox views are periodically censored out of its Wikipedia article by power users (senior editors). The [removal of views by Christina Hoff Sommers and Naomi Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_objectification&diff=1020578292&oldid=1020577791) on the subject is a good example. If you were just reading the latest version of the Wikipedia article, you would only get the censored version - but if you perused the page history and unearthed these deleted passages, you get to see a more comprehensive (i.e., umm ... encyclopedic) view on it.

[Here's another example](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_objectification&diff=1020575648&oldid=1019253515), one that I find more interesting, and an illustration of what I call 'soft censorship'. Here, the editor censored out a bunch of entries from the 'See also' section, presumably because it goes contrary to the doctrine of objectification.
