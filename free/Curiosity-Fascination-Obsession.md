# Curiosity :arrow_right: Fascination ➡️ Obsession

From [Something Has Definitely Changed In Me
](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/audiotapeddialogues/somethinghaschangedinme.htm),

> Q(1): It becomes an obsession.
> 
> R: Yes. We talked about that, about being fascinated first of all, and then becoming obsessed. First of all one becomes ==curious== – curiosity is inherent – about what it is to be a human being. I call this being interested. When this interest develops into a ==fascination==, one does not have to generate enthusiasm, as is the case when one is merely interested. Fascination pulls one forward. Not many people become fascinated with life, the universe, and what it is to be a human being. They **eventually lose interest**. Fascination makes it **easy to investigate**. Fascination leads to ==obsession==.

> I remember you saying some time ago that you had become obsessed – which I was very pleased to hear. It may initially sound strange, to someone who does not realise what we are talking about, to have as one’s aim becoming obsessed. However, one does not have any success with becoming free from the Human Condition without becoming obsessed. That is what swings one through into ‘something else’.
