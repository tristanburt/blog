The marquee scrollers from [This Moment of Being Alive](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm) best summarizes the actualism method:

- Begin by asking, [[This Moment|each moment again]], ‘[[How am I experiencing this moment of being alive]]’?
- Note: asking how I am experiencing this moment of [[Being here now|being alive]] is *not* the actualism method.
- ==Consistently enjoying and appreciating [[This Moment|this moment]] of being alive *is* the actualism method.==
- The means to the end – an ongoing enjoyment and appreciation – are no different to the end.
- Enjoyment and appreciation are facilitated by *feeling* as happy and as harmless as possible.
- Felicity and innocuity are potently enabled by minimising both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ feelings.
- An [[Affective Awareness|affective awareness]] is the key to maximising felicity and innocuity over all alternate feelings.
- A slightest [[Diminishment|diminishment]] of enjoyment and appreciation automatically activates attentiveness.
- [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|Attentiveness to the cause]] of diminished enjoyment and appreciation restores felicity/innocuity.
- The habituation of actualistic [[Affective Awareness|awareness]] and [[Aware-Cum-Attentive|attentiveness]] requires a [[Diligence and perseverance|persistent initialisation]].
- Persistent initialisation segues into [[Affective Awareness|a wordless approach, a non-verbal attitude]] towards life.
- ==Consistently enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive is what the actualism method is.==

From [What is the Answer to ‘How Am I Experiencing this Moment of Being Alive?’](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/frequentquestions/FAQ20a.htm)

**RESPONDENT:** _<font color="#DD2200">Can someone please list the laws contained within the method that enable one to minimise the [[Social Identity|social identity]] and the instinctual passions?</font>_

**RICHARD:** Nope ... however, the experiential processes contained within the actualism method can be:

1. Activate the long-ago buried [[Sincerity|sincerity]] so as to make possible a pure intent to bring about peace and harmony sooner rather than later.  
2. Set the standard of experiencing, [[This Moment|each moment]] again, as feeling felicitous/ innocuous come-what-may.  
3. Where felicity/ innocuity is not occurring find out why not.  
4. Seeing the silliness at having felicity/ innocuity be [[Diminishment|usurped]], by either the negative or positive feelings, for whatever reason that might be automatically restores felicity/ innocuity.  
5. Repeated occurrences of the same cause for felicity/ innocuity loss alerts pre-recognition of impending [[Diminishment|dissipation]] which enables pre-emption and ensures a more persistent felicity/ innocuity through habituation.  
6. Habitual felicity/ innocuity, and its concomitant enjoyment and appreciation, facilitates [[Benevolence and Naivete|naïve]] [[Sensuousness|sensuosity]] ... a consistent state of wide-eyed wonder, amazement, marvel, and [[Delight|delight]].  
7. [[Benevolence and Naivete|Naiveté]], in conjunction with felicitous/ innocuous sensuosity, being the nearest a ‘self’ can come to innocence, allows the overarching benignity and benevolence inherent to the infinitude this infinite and eternal and perpetual universe actually is to operate more and more freely.  
8. This intrinsic benignity and benevolence, which has nothing to do with affective happiness and [[Harmlessness|harmlessness]], will do the rest.  
9. Sit back and enjoy the ride of a lifetime!

> **RESPONDENT:** _It’s interesting that in practicing Actualism, we need to be in touch with our emotions enough to not be detached, but not so much in touch with them that we get dissociated as in enlightenment._
> 
> **RICHARD:** For the sake of clarity in communication I would stress that the actualism method **sits firmly upon the minimisation** of both the ‘good’ and ‘bad’ feelings and **the optimisation** of the felicitous/ [[Harmlessness|innocuous]] feelings ... and ==merely being in touch with felicity will not do the trick==.

> **RESPONDENT:** _... but I see what is missing is I must generate felicity as my resident mood and not just be in touch with it sometimes._
> 
> **RICHARD:** Yes ... and then, further along the way, be felicitous/ innocuous (‘I’ am ‘my’ feelings and ‘my’ feelings are ‘me’).

> **RESPONDENT:** _... but thank you for pointing out why because, obviously, how can I be happy when my attitude is ‘I didn’t ask to be born.’? HA!_
> 
> **RICHARD:** Indeed not ... that [[Basic Resentment|basic resentment]], the fundamental grievance, will dog every best effort otherwise and render all endeavour useless.
