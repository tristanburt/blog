      RICHARD: [..] the very reason, <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>the underlying cause</span>, for the existence of anger amongst the whole suite of affective feelings was the <strong>basic resentment at having to be alive in the first place</strong> (as expressed in popular phrases such as ‘I didn’t ask to be born!’ and ‘Life’s a bitch and then you die!’ and so forth) … whereas the reason, <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>the trigger</span>, for getting angry varied according to a range of situations and circumstances.

    <ul class='my-3 ml-6 space-y-1 list-disc'>
      
        <li>
          ‘resentment: an indignant sense of injury or insult received or perceived, a sense of grievance; (a feeling of) ill will, bitterness, or anger against a person or thing; spec. a negative attitude towards society or authority arising, often unconsciously, from aggressive envy and hostility, frustrated by a feeling of inferiority or impotence’. (Oxford Dictionary).
        </li>
      
        <li>
          ‘resentment: a feeling of indignant displeasure or persistent ill will at something regarded as a wrong, insult, or injury [offence implies hurt displeasure; resentment suggests a longer lasting indignation or smouldering ill will]’. (Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary).

        <li>
          ‘resentment: indignation [righteous anger at something wrongful, unjust, or evil] or ill will felt as a result of a real or imagined grievance; indignant smouldering anger generated by a sense of grievance’.

   since then. The <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>first step was to say ‘YES’ to <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being here</a> on earth</span>, for I located and identified that <strong>basic resentment</strong> that all people that I have spoken to have.

      RESPONDENT: …[the basic concerns underlying the distinction above are valid], but the feeling of aversion to the idea of feeling-good-for-its-own-sake is not.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      RICHARD: Okay then … generally speaking, an ‘aversion’ to be going about one’s everyday/ workaday life with a general feeling of well-being (a.k.a. ‘feeling good’), for the remainder of one’s life, stems from a <strong>basic resentment at being alive</strong> – of being in the sublunar realm as a sensitive, affective and cognitive human being with people as-they-are in the world as-it-is – as is epitomised by such expressive plaints as ‘I didn’t ask to be born’ or ‘It’s all just a sick joke’ or ‘Life’s a bitch with death at the end’ and so on.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Furthermore, for such a sensitive, affective and cognitive human being who is also at all thoughtful about life, the universe and what it is to be living in the world as-it-is with people as-they-are, any such idea of ‘feeling-good-for-its-own-sake’ ̶ let alone enjoying and appreciating being able to experience that general feeling of well-being (as in, an engaged <a href='delight' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkBranch'>relishing</a> of feeling good and, thus, intimately approving <a href='being-here-now' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>being alive/ being here</a>, by virtue of that personal delectation of ‘feeling good’ per se) as well – is a betrayal of all what they fervently hold <a href='armchair' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>intellectually dear</a>, about the world in general and the human race in particular, as for them life itself is, essentially, a bum rap (an unjust punishment) when all is said and done.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      It is pertinent to note, at this point, that the root cause of sorrow – and, hence, malice (e.g., the ‘<strong>basic resentment</strong>’ above) – is being forever locked-out of paradise.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      The ‘unjust punishment’ component (or some such similar ‘unfair’ and/or ‘inequitable’ grievance) <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>stems from an inchoate primeval feeling of having been somehow disenfranchised</span> from a fabulous pre-historic ‘golden age’ (e.g., the ‘Garden of Eden’ theme) posited, via variations of a ‘Status Gratiae’ style supposition, upon a numinous/ pre-sinful ‘innocence’ – or even from similarly fabulated prepubescent ‘golden years’ (e.g., the ‘Glimpses of a Golden Childhood’ theme) posited, via variations of a ‘Tabula Rasa’ style supposition, upon a juvenile/ pre-sexual ‘innocence’ – which presupposes there really is a lost ‘innocence’ to be regained.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Yet innocence as a liveable actuality – an actual innocence (not the pseudo-innocence of those ‘State of Grace’ and ‘Blank Slate’ fabulations above) in other words – is entirely new to human experience/ human history.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      VINEETO: When I applied the actualism method – being attentive to how I experience each moment of being alive with the intent of being happy and considerate towards others – one of the first obstacles I discovered was my <strong>basic resentment</strong> of being here as in ‘I wasn’t asked to be born’ and ‘the world is not how I want it to be’ and ‘people don’t behave as I want them to behave’. This basic resentment was like <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>a bad habit that continuously spoiled my enjoyment</span> of whatever I was doing and <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>interfered with my being in harmony</span> with whomever I met and interacted with – <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>both at work 🏢 and at home 🏠</span>.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Once I recognized the silliness of this bad habit it was fairly easy to prevent it from reoccurring by applying an <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>ongoing attentiveness</a> as to how I was feeling <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>each moment</a> again. By doing so, I discovered that this <strong>basic resentment</strong> towards being here had various branches – one of them was that in most cases people, including me, have to work 🏢 for their livelihood. Once I stopped resenting the fact that I have to trade some of my time and expertise in exchange for tokens, which I then use for buying food, clothes, shelter and toys, my whole attitude towards and experience of work began to change. Not only is food a requisite, it is also a pleasure, not only are clothes a requisite, they provide warmth and comfort, not only is shelter a requisite, it provides comfort, cosiness and convenience and any money left over after purchasing necessities can purchase what toys I find interesting from the increasingly inexpensive and ever-widening array of adult toys.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      With the intent of being as happy and harmless as humanly possible the nature of the task at hand became obvious – work 🏢, i.e. the time and expertise sold in exchange for tokens, not only needs to benefit those I offer it to but it also needs to be enjoyable for me in order to achieve a win-win situation for all participants in the game.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      I don’t need to be ‘nurturing’ towards others, as you describe it, because I no longer need to rely on such fickle feelings to cover up or bandage over the underlying resentment I used to feel towards others – on the contrary I am in an excellent mood every day and I actually care for the wellbeing of those for whom I work and for those I work with and almost always enjoy their company while we work together. I don’t need to <a href='love' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>love</a> them because I am not hostile or resentful towards them nor do I need to be loved by them because I am not down on myself, I enjoy what I do and I care that they get the best for the amount of time they bought. They are above all – not after all – my fellow human beings.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      To put it succinctly – the <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'><strong>basic feeling of resentment</strong> is replaced by joie the vivre</span> and <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>fellowship regard feelings of ‘nurturing’ or caring are replaced by <a href='harmless' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>actual caring</a></span> for one’s fellow human beings.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      The other benefit of actualism in regards to work 🏢 was that I began to be able to sensibly assess my needs rather than be driven by senseless desires in order to be able to sell less time for livelihood and toys and have more free time to do with as I choose.

      VINEETO: [..] When I first became aware, really aware, about the <strong>enormous resentment</strong> I had about being here, all the little and big ‘buts’ that I normally came up with when complaining about life on this wonderful planet, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was astounded that this overall seemingly all-encompassing feeling about each and everything I encountered had such a simple label. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>When I applied its label it turned into something about which I was able to make a choice</span> – to feel resentment or not to feel resentment. It really is as simple as that. At that moment when I dropped all of my resentment in one go, just for <a href='this-moment' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>this moment in time</a>, it was as if a veil opened and I could see the world as it actually is, in all its beneficial splendour – with the sole exception of passionate human beings fighting and killing each other … and the only thing I can do about it is stop being driven by my own instinctual passions and stop being part of humanity altogether.

      PETER: [..] What I see in the human condition, and have discovered operating in ‘me’ and as ‘me’, is a <strong>basic feeling of resentment</strong> intrinsic to being a human being. This base-line feeling is what fuels much of the resentment against other individuals, groups, tribes or countries who are seen to be, or who are, more powerful, more wealthy, more fortunate, and so on. Many <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>seek to counteract</span> their feelings of resentment with the antidotal feeling of <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>self-<a href='righteousness' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>righteousness</a></span> whereby they aspire to feeling ‘above’ the ‘ignorant’ behaviour of others, whilst many others seek solace in <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'><a href='gratitude' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>feeling grateful</a></span> to their own personal protector-God.

    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      PETER: [..] an essential first step is to take a long look at one’s own deeply-ingrained <strong>resentment at being born and having to be here</strong>. If one cares to break this <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>habit</span> of feeling resentful – and avoid the traditional antidotal trap of feeling <a href='gratitude' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>gratitude</a> to Someone or Something – the fact that one no longer <strong>feels resentful for being here</strong> disempowers the very driving force for one’s resentfulness towards one’s fellow human beings together with feelings such as anger, pity, jealousy and envy. The accompanying essential step is to stop focussing one’s attention on how you perceive, as in intuitively feel, others to be and to start <a href='aware-cum-attentive' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>paying exclusive attention</a> to the only person whose feelings, intentions, <a href='sincerity' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>sincerity</a> and integrity you can know for certain – <a href='identity/genetic' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>‘me’</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      Now the difficulty in actually doing either of these things is that both of them run contrary to the human condition – <strong>resentment at having to be here</strong> is par for the course within the human condition as is the ongoing obsession with intuiting or interpreting the feelings and motivations of one’s fellow human beings, and not only those human beings we actually get to meet or communicate with directly but also those we have never ever met, based on the by-and-large biased reports of yet others.
    </p>
  
    <p class='mb-3'>
      But then again that’s the challenge intrinsic to the process of actualism – to do something radically different to what everyone else has been biologically programmed to do and <a href='identity/social' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>socially conditioned</a> to think and feel, to be sensible in that one obeys the laws and conforms to societal protocols yet be <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>a rebel</span> in that one devotes one’s life to not only breaking free from the crowd but to become actually free of the human condition itself.

      RICHARD: Please note this does not imply anger was extinguished (as that requires the ending of the instinctual passions via the extinction of the feeling-being formed thereof) but, rather, that anger as such never featured thereafter – never arose again – for the remainder of ‘his’ life. Concomitantly, <a href='harmless' class='text-pink-600 mavenLinkBold hover:underline' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>hatred</a> similarly disappeared out of ‘his’ day-to-day living as well although ‘he’ did not notice this until maybe six-to-eight weeks later when in a discussion ‘his’ then-wife raised on the topic. In fact, <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>the feeling of hate was so far removed from ‘his’ everyday life ‘he’ could not remember too well what it felt like</span> (in the aforementioned discussion with ‘his’ then-wife ‘he’ somewhat hesitantly recollected hatred as feeling ‘cold’ but she was adamant it was a ‘hot’ feeling).

      <div><p>RICHARD: <strong>Gratitude</strong> is one of the many ploys designed, by those who expound on the merits of self-imposed suffering, to keep one in servile ignominy and creeping despair. As strange as it may initially seem, gratitude has the same deleterious effect upon one’s well-being as the <a href='basic-resentment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>resentment</a> it seeks to reform. When gratitude is realised as being the panacea that it is, one will gladly renounce it along with the resentment it promises to replace. To successfully dispense with the despised resentment, its companion emotion, the extolled gratitude, must also go. It is a popular misconception that one can do away with a ‘bad’ emotion whilst hanging on to the ‘good’ one. In actualism the third alternative always applies. ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’, ‘Right’ and ‘Wrong’, ‘Virtue’ and ‘Sin’, ‘Hope’ and ‘Despair’, ‘Gratitude’ and ‘Resentment’, and so on, all disappear in the perfection of purity. Purity is the hall-mark of the stillness that is the essential character of the infinitude of the universe … which is the life-giving foundation of all that is apparent. Unless the factuality of the existence of the third alternative is firmly grasped, one is forever fated to shuttle back and forth between the opposites. <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>Gratitude simply does not work for it draws its energy from resentment itself … and from nowhere else. Gratitude feeds off resentment – one cannot be grateful unless one is first resentful – and one cannot maintain any emotion without retaining its opposite.</span> Neither does one adopt that other stratagem: transcendence. Transcendence is a form of sublimation … to transcend is to confirm and endorse the reality of the opposites. One disposes of all these pathetic methods very simply: By being here now as this flesh and blood body.</p></div>

      <div><p>RICHARD: The first sentence of above paragraph is specifically designed to get one out of ‘stuckness’ … it is not intended as an on-going way of living life. It is a short, sharp shock of attention – a ‘kick-start’ in the jargon – to <span class='bg-yellow-200 px-2 py-0.5 rounded-xl'>counteract</span> the ‘I didn’t ask to be born’ <a href='basic-resentment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>resentment</a> that caused the stuckness in the first place. Another ‘wake-up jab’ (which makes use of any remnant of pride) is to ask oneself: ‘I have two choices right now: being happy and harmless or being dull and degenerate … which way do I sensibly choose to spend this never-to-be-repeated precious moment of living so that I can honestly call myself a mature adult?’</p></div>

      <div><p>VINEETO: Now, that my ‘self’ has lost the grip over me most of the time, I am simply doing what is happening and enjoy what I am doing. That doing may be working for people, sorting their financial affairs, writing letters, thinking something through, watching TV, redressing web-pages, cooking a meal, washing dishes, having lunch in town or lying on the couch. Having eliminated the <a href='basic-resentment' class='text-gray-600 font-bold hover:bg-gray-50' data-wikilink-type='WikiLinkNormal'>basic resentment</a> of ‘having to be here’, I now find that whatever I do is the <strong>delightful</strong> expression of being alive.
