> The foil to Minimalism is historically Maximalism," says Cal. "Coming across some app that gives you a little bit of convenience, the maximalist says, 'If I don't download that app and use it, it's like someone is stealing from me.' Maximalism is what drives people in the digital space to download everything and use everything if there's any value or any convenience.
>
> "Minimalism is the opposite, which says, 'Only focus on the big wins and, on purpose, ignore the small wins.'"
>
> The key here is being intentional. When you're ==careful, cognizant, and selective== about how you use the technology at your disposal, you're able to leverage the technology that benefits you instead of being leveraged into using the technology that benefits someone else's agenda.

From [Tony Wolski](https://awol.ski/books/digital-minimalism/),

> … the very act of being ==selective== about your tools will bring you satisfaction, typically much more than what is lost from the tools you decide to avoid.
>
> … it’s the ==commitment== to minimalism itself that yields the bulk of their satisfaction. The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the ==meaningful== glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.
