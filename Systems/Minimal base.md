At minimum, I rely only on these software that runs on all major platforms[^win]:

- A web browser with adblock (eg: [[Brave]], Safari)
- [[Nix]]# (reproducible development environment)
- [[Syncthing]]# (file sync)
- [[Pass with GPG]]# (encrypted secrets & passwords)
- [[VSCode]]#

Everything else is optional. This allows me to use any OS as I see fit, *as well* move between them as the situation requires, without developing dependency on one. Hence, "minimal base" of software use/dependency.

[^win]: On [[Windows]], WSL2 can be utilized to work with some of these software (`pass` and syncthing).

## Inspiration

Inspiration for this stance comes from a combination of #[[Intention trumps convenience]] and the [suckless] philosophy.
